To generate a key:
    openssl genrsa -out ${DOMAIN}.key 4096
Make sure to keep it private!

To generate a CSR (Certificate Signing Request from a key):
    openssl req -new -key ${DOMAIN}.key -out ${DOMAIN}.csr -subj "/C=US/ST=/L=/O=/CN=${DOMAIN}" -sha512

The StartSSL certificate will generate a certificate in exchange for a certificate signing request. Then...
To generate the .pem files in this directory, concatenate
 - server certificate (.crt)
 - intermediate certificate (sca.server1.crt)
   # wget https://www.startssl.com/certs/sca.server1.crt 
 - ca certficate is left out, or some browsers will complain
   # https://www.startssl.com/certs/ca.crt

    cat ${DOMAIN}.crt sca.server1.crt >${DOMAIN}.pem
